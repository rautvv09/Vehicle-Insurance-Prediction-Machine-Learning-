# 🚗 Vehicle Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a **vehicle insurance claim** will be made based on **policyholder details, vehicle specifications, safety features, and location factors**.  
The goal is to help insurance companies **assess risk, reduce losses, and optimize premium pricing** using data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Insurance companies face significant losses due to inaccurate risk assessment.  
This project builds a **machine learning classification model** to predict:

> **Will an insurance claim be filed? (Yes / No)**

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains real-world insurance-related attributes including:

- Policyholder information (age, policy tenure)
- Vehicle details (segment, fuel type, engine type, dimensions)
- Safety features (brake assist, airbags, fog lights, etc.)
- Location factors (area cluster, population density)
- Target variable: **`is_claim`**

**Target Variable**
- `0` → No Claim  
- `1` → Claim
